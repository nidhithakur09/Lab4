Here we are using Linear Regression model to find the type of fish using it's height,width and weight. Then the file is converted to pickle file and used with flaskapp to create a local host url. HTML and CSS is also created for frontend development. These files are then uploaded in GITHUB where this repo is connected to Heroku so we can create an web URL to access it online

Need of this Project:
Frontend Development
API development
Data processing
Data classification
Report generating
Getting started:
Clone this repo to your local host
Using the pickle file run the FlaskApp in local with the html and css of your design
Create a new repo and upload all the files provided in this repo along with your pickle file and FlaskApp file
